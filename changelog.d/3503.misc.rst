Added filter to ignore external ``.egg-info`` files in manifest.

Some plugins might rely on the fact that the ``.egg-info`` directory is
produced inside the project dir, which may not be the case in editable installs
(the ``.egg-info`` directory is produced inside the metadata directory given by
the build frontend via PEP 660 hooks).
