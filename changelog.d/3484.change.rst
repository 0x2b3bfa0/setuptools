Added *transient* ``compat`` mode to editable installs.
This more will be temporarily available (to facilitate the transition period)
for those that want to emulate the behavior of the ``develop`` command
(in terms of what is added to ``sys.path``).
This mode is provided "as is", with limited support, and will be removed in
future versions of ``setuptools``.
