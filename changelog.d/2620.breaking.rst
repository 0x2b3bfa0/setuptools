If neither ``license_file`` nor ``license_files`` is specified, the ``sdist``
option will now auto-include files that match the following patterns:
``LICEN[CS]E*``, ``COPYING*``, ``NOTICE*``, ``AUTHORS*``.
This matches the behavior of ``bdist_wheel``.
Any ``exclude`` in ``MANIFEST.in`` will overwrite it. -- by :user:`cdce8p`
