Mark the easy_install script and setuptools command as deprecated, and use `pip <https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/>`_ when available to fetch/build wheels for missing ``setup_requires``/``tests_require`` requirements, with the following differences in behavior:
 * support for ``python_requires``
 * better support for wheels (proper handling of priority with respect to PEP 425 tags)
 * PEP 517/518 support
 * eggs are not supported
 * no support for the ``allow_hosts`` easy_install option (``index_url``/``find_links`` are still honored)
 * pip environment variables are honored (and take precedence over easy_install options)
