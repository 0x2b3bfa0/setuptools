Removed the conversion of dashes to underscores in the :code:`extras_require` and :code:`data_files` of :code:`setup.cfg` to support the usage of dashes. Method will warn users when they use a dash-separated key which in the future will only allow an underscore. Note: the method performs the dash to underscore conversion to preserve compatibility, but future versions will no longer support it -- by :user:`melissa-kun-li`
