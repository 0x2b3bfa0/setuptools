Added implementation for *editable install* hooks (PEP 660).

By default the users will experience a *lenient* behavior  which prioritises
the ability of the users of changing the distributed packages (e.g. adding new
files or removing old ones).
But they can also opt into a *strict* mode, which will try to replicate as much
as possible the behavior of the package as if it would be normally installed by
end users. The *strict* editable installation is not able to detect if files
are added or removed from the project (a new installation is required).

.. important::
   The *editable* aspect of the *editable install* supported this implementation
   is restricted to the Python modules contained in the distributed package.
   Changes in binary extensions (e.g. C/C++), entry-point definitions,
   dependencies, metadata, datafiles, etc may require a new installation.
