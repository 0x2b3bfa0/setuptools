Extracted text about automatic resource extraction and the zip-safe flag
from ``userguide/miscellaneous`` to ``deprecated/resource_extraction`` and
``deprecated/zip_safe``.

Extracted text about additional metadata files from
``userguide/miscellaneous`` into the existing ``userguide/extension``
document.

Updated ``userguide/extension`` to better reflect the status of the
setuptools project.

Removed ``userguide/functionalities_rewrite`` (a virtually empty part of the
docs).
