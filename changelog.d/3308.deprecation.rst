Relying on ``include_package_data`` to ensure sub-packages are automatically
added to the build wheel distribution (as "data") is now considered a
deprecated practice.

This behaviour was controversial and caused inconsistencies (#3260).

Instead, projects are encouraged to properly configure ``packages`` or use
discovery tools. General information can be found in :doc:`userguide/package_discovery`.
