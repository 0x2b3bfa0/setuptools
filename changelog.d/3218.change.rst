Prevented builds from erroring (**temporarily**) if the project specifies
metadata via ``pyproject.toml``, but uses other files (e.g. ``setup.py``) to
complement it, without setting ``dynamic`` properly.

.. important::
   This is a **transitional** behaviour.
   Future releases of ``setuptools`` may simply ignore externally set metadata
   not backed by ``dynamic`` or even halt the build with an error.
