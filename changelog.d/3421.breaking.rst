Drop setuptools' support for installing an entrypoint extra requirements at load time:
- the functionality has been broken since v60.8.0.
- the mechanism to do so is deprecated (`fetch_build_eggs`).
- that use case (e.g. a custom command class entrypoint) is covered by making sure the necessary build requirements are declared.
