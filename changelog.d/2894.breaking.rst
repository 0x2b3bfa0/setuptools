If you purposefully want to create an *"empty distribution"*, please be aware
that some Python files (or general folders) might be automatically detected and
included.

Projects that currently don't specify both ``packages`` and ``py_modules`` in their
configuration and contain extra folders or Python files (not meant for distribution),
might see these files being included in the wheel archive or even experience
the build to fail.

You can check details about the automatic discovery (and how to configure a
different behaviour) in :doc:`/userguide/package_discovery`.
