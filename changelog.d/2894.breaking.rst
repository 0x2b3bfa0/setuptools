If you purposefully want to create an *"empty distribution"*, please be aware
that some Python files (or general folders) might be automatically detected and
included.

Projects that currently don't specify ``packages``, ``py_modules`` and
``ext_modules`` in their configuration and have extra Python files and folders
(not meant for distribution), might see these files being included in the wheel
archive.

You can check details about the automatic discovery behaviour (and
how to configure a different one) in :doc:`/userguide/package_discovery`.
