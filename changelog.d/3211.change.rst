Disabled auto-discovery when distribution class has a ``configuration``
attribute (e.g. when the ``setup.py`` script contains ``setup(...,
configuration=...)``).  This is done to ensure extension-only packages created
with ``numpy.distutils.misc_util.Configuration`` are not broken by the safe
guard
behaviour to avoid accidental multiple top-level packages in a flat-layout.

.. note::
   Users that don't set ``packages``, ``py_modules``, or ``configuration`` are
   still likely to observe the auto-discovery behavior, which may halt the
   build if the project contains multiple directories and/or multiple Python
   files directly under the project root.

   To disable auto-discovery please explicitly set either ``packages`` or
   ``py_modules``. Alternatively you can also configure :ref:`custom-discovery`.
